<----Note---->
NB. ignore the bottom navigation bar, do not hard code every card on the design, rather make it  single component and 
use it multible times. eg. on Home screen there are multiple cards used to display multiple users code only one card and use it 
multiple times to save time. Ignore the Report and Logout, or Logout that is displayed on the screens it will be a popup.
Return a SafeAreaView on each screen. Do not put the header inside a scrollView. 
Most of the packages are installed check inside package.json
example: 
    <SafeAreaView> //Do it like this
        <Header />
        <scrollView>
        </scrollView>
    </SafeAreaView>


<--------Width------->

width is 93% of the screen for the view
use "useWindowDimensions", which is imported from "react-native", for the app to be responsive
examples:
"const {width, height} = useWindowDimensions();" add this line under the ur function just like in Header.js
How to use: {marginHorizontal: width* 0.03,width: width* 0.93} inside inline style
93% of the width of the screen = width* 0.93 Or use Width: '93%',


<----For icons use:----->

import { Icon } from "react-native-gradient-icon";
<Icon  size={32} //the size must always be 32
        colors={[
            {color:"#B615DE",offset:"0",opacity:"1"}, //don`t change the colors
            {color:"#D428A8",offset:"1",opacity:"1"},
        ]}
        name="md-arrow-back" //replace this with the ionicon icon name u want to use
        type="ionicon" 
/>


<----components----->

The header component is created and it takes a boolean prop "withBackIcon" which must be false if the back icon must not be displayed,
true if the back icon must be displayed.

A CustomeBtn component is created which will be used as our default button on multiple screens, the component takes "text and onPress" props,
 "text" prop is the text that will be written on the button eg. SignUp button will receive a prop of text='SignUp'.

 InputText height is {height: height*0.06}
